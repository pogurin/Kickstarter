there are four models
A user model. A project model. A rewards model. And a pledges model.
A  pledges belongs to a user.  -> A User makes a pledge                   
A  pledge also belongs to a project -> A project has many pledges 
A reward belongs to a project -> A project has many rewards
A project can belong to one user -->A user owns many project 
A project can be backed by many users through pledges - Many users can back a project through pledges - many pledges belonging to many users can back many projects 
A user can have many backed_projects and owned_projecs 

2 types of user - onwer and a backer
there is one type of pledge, that which can be given from a backer to a project.
A project has many rewards.
A owner can have one or more projects.  





* When a new pledge *
New pledge is created WHEN the user is logged in and FROM the Project.show view

Pledge belongs to user AND project
Thus an Id for each is created 
new instance of backer_id is created (?)


amount - entered by user
created at : rails
updated at : rails
backer_id : derived by user params
project_id: rails  derived by project params

W###hen a new project is created###

A new project is created WHEN the user is logged in from the Projects new page  

When a project is created, many rewards are created (cocoon)

A project has many rewards 
	referenced  FROM :rewards forgein key project_id

A project has many :backers from the user class through pledges (indirect)
	referenced FROM :pledges foreignkey backer_id

A project belongs to :owner  (class name: user) 
	reference TO :owner through forgein key  owner_id
